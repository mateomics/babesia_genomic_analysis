# Comparative and functional genomics of the protozoan parasite Babesia divergens highlighting the invasion and egress processes
> Article Summary

The article analyzes *comparative and functional genomics* in the protozoan parasite --from the eukaryotic domain-- Babesia divergens, with special emphasis on the processes of invasion and egress from host cells throughout its life cycle.

### Reference Organism
Babesia divergens is a parasite that causes *babesiosis* in humans and livestock, mainly in Europe but increasingly worldwide, suggesting that it is a zoonotic  disease (inter-species). This disease is similar in its symptoms to malaria and, being so, affects red blood cells. In the study, the Bd 87 strain, isolated from humans, was specifically used.

### Objectives of the article
- To improve the quality of B. divergens genome assembly by using previously existing sequencing data along with various computational tools and assembly strategies.
- Analyze differential gene expression in the two stages of the parasite's life cycle using RNAseq: free merozoite, before invading erythrocytes, and the intraerythrocytic parasitic stage.
- Explore synteny between different Babesia species through B. divergens using comparative genomic analysis.
- Propose molecular mechanisms and elucidate the mechanisms of infection of B. divergens by identifying genes related to the processes of invasion, motility, mobile binding, and egress.

### Specific objectives of the project
- Learn how to download *fastq* files correctly.
- Improve our skills in the usage of the *NCBI* platform.
- Download the improved *B. divergens* genome directly from *NCBI*.
- Find genes by aligning RNAseq sequences with the reference genome.
- Replicate the differential expression analysis performed on the parasite in the article, subject to the possibility of using the same compilation of 33 genes.
- For those genes found, search for their annotation via BLAST.
- Interpret differentially expressed genes according to the stage of *B. divergens*.
- Compare the results obtained with those in the article.

### Expected results of the project
- Obtain genes expressed within the genome.
- Find differentiation in the expression of B. divergens genes between both stages of its life cycle.
- Look foward for specific functions on each differentially expressed gene.
- Elucidate a biological explanation for the observed differential expression.
